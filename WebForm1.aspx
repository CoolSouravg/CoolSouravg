        In today’s digital age, libraries face the challenge of managing vast collections of resources while providing efficient services to users. Traditional library management methods often fall short in meeting the needs of both librarians and patrons, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced user satisfaction. As libraries strive to adapt to technological advancements, the implementation of a robust Library Management System becomes crucial.

This dissertation focuses on the development and deployment of a Library Management System using modern web technologies, specifically C#, ASP.NET, MS SQL, and Azure. 
        
        The primary objective of this project is to design a user-friendly application that streamlines library operations, such as catalog management, user registration, and loan processing. By leveraging cloud-based services on Azure, the system aims to offer scalability, reliability, and enhanced accessibility for library staff and patrons.

The scope of this project includes the design and implementation of core functionalities required for effective library management. The application will integrate advanced features like user authentication, real-time data updates, and a responsive interface designed with CSS and Bootstrap. By deploying the system on Azure, the project also explores the benefits of cloud computing in providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for libraries.

The significance of this project lies in its potential to revolutionize how libraries operate, offering a more streamlined and efficient approach to managing resources. 
        
        By addressing existing challenges and embracing new technologies, the Library Management System aims to enhance the overall user experience and facilitate better resource management.

This dissertation is organized into several chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the project and its objectives. Chapter 2 reviews the existing literature on library management systems and related technologies. Chapter 3 details the design and development process, while Chapter 4 focuses on deployment strategies. Finally, Chapter 5 presents the results and discusses future improvements.
